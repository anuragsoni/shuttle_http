(** [is_safe t] returns true if the semantics for a HTTP method are essentially read-only,
    and the client does not expect any state change on the server as a result of the
    request.

    See {:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-4.2.1} for more details. *)
val is_safe : t -> bool

(** [is_idempotent t] returns true if multiple requests with a HTTP method are intended to
    have the same effect on the server as a single such request. This function returns
    true for PUT, DELETE and all safe methods.

    See {:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-4.2.2} for more details. *)
val is_idempotent : t -> bool

(** [is_cacheable t] indicates that responses to requests with an HTTP method are allowed
    to be strored for future reuse. This function returns true for GET, HEAD and POST.
