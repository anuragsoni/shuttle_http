# Shuttle_http

Shuttle_http is a HTTP/1.1 implementation for OCaml that uses [async](https://opensource.janestreet.com/async/) to provide asynchronous servers and clients.

This is a relatively low-level library that attempts to provide building blocks for writing http servers and clients. The goal for this library is to be a building block for other libraries and applications.
